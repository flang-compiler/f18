# Investigating FIR as an MLIR Dialect

## Introduction

With the availability of the extensible MLIR framework as
open-source, we've been investigating the potential to use MLIR as
a substrate upon which to build a FIR dialect. This document will
explain the motivations and the shape of this subproject using MLIR
to define and implement a high-level operational representation of
Fortran. (See also [Design: Fortran IR](https://bit.ly/2WWRus0)
for more information.)

### What is MLIR?

The MLIR project is an open-sourced project on Github.
[MLIR](https://github.com/tensorflow/mlir) is being built as a
common multi-level intermediate representation (IR) for the
TensorFlow machine learning tools. It provides a common IR
framework for building multiple layers of representation called
dialects. These dialects can be transformed (converted) from one to
another allowing for optimizations and successive lowering of the
IR down to backend code generators. MLIR supports multiple backends. The
LLVM IR dialect is a pre-defined MLIR dialect
that can be targeted
for final code generation using the LLVM library and/or tools.
MLIR is explicitly intended to be extensible such that
other projects can add their own dialects.

Out of the box, MLIR supports a refined polyhedral model for
transforming affine operations on array data. These mathematically-based
representations will help realize F18's higher level goals of composing,
transforming, and optimizing Fortran array operations for HPC.

### What is meant by a FIR dialect?

MLIR has no support for Fortran out of the box. Support for Fortran must
be built and added through the extensibility features of MLIR. This
process of extending MLIR is called adding a dialect. In our case, we'll
add a FIR dialect for representation of Fortran programs.

Specifically, this means that we can proceed with the plan as laid out
in the Fortran IR design document with the advantages of not having to
build from scratch our own

-    IR infrastructure    
-    LLVM IR bridge  
-    Common optimization passes (For example: CSE, DCE, loop fusion, loop
     invariant code motion, loop tiling, loop unroll and jam, loop
     unrolling, vectorization, etc.)
    
A dialect can be thought of
as its own distinct IR, where the design and
semantics of the IR are domain-specific for the purposes of the
dialect. Specifically, MLIR supports a modern IR design with

-    A predefined set of operations with precise semantics
-    Structural/logical grouping of sets of operations
-    Explicit control flow
-    Explicit data-flow
-    Strong typing

-    Meta information

     Informally, one can construct MLIR operations that are
     conceptually composable containers. These containers can have
     strongly typed metadata attached to them that can describe
     any properties of interest. For example, one can define an
     operation called "execute" and define it to have an attribute
     "order", which may have a value that describes a sequential
     execution order, a fully parallel unordered execution, or some
     valid execution partial ordering. What meta information is
     interesting depends on the context and is up to the MLIR user.

This document describes FIR, which is a set of extensions upon the
standard MLIR dialect. When lowering a Fortran parse tree to FIR,
the compiler will produce a mix of operations defined in the FIR
dialect, the MLIR __standard dialect__, and other pre-defined
dialects, such as the [affine dialect](https://bit.ly/2XYDPNj).

#### Disclaimers

This document is not a tutorial on compilers, Fortran, MLIR, LLVM,
intermediate representations, abstraction levels, semantics, nor type
theory.

## Requirements Unchanged

The FIR dialect has the same requirements as spelled out in the
Fortran IR design document. Specifically, the FIR dialect will
capture the control flow structure of the Fortran source-level
program. At the highest level of abstraction, Fortran computations
will be captured as coarse-grain opaque
operations corresponding to Fortran expressions
(with links to `Fortran::evaluate::Expr<T>` objects from the
front-end), where only the peripheral use-def information is
exposed. These operations will, of course, necessarily be lowered
to other various MLIR dialects, where they can be
optimized.
The compiler will continue to lower the representation
of the input with successive transformations
to MLIR's LLVM IR dialect, the target independent LLVM IR, machine
IR, and eventually assembly and/or machine code.

## Details

Because MLIR is our adopted framework, our bridge to the FIR
dialect of MLIR will use the concepts, libraries, coding
conventions, etc. of the MLIR project. This means some of the class
names will necessarily be changed from the original FIR design. For
example, `Program` becomes `Module`, `Procedure` becomes
`Function`, `BasicBlock` becomes `Block`, and `Statement` becomes
`Operation`.

Construction of the CFG structure reuses the original FIR pass that
flattens and linearizes the Fortran parse tree structure prior to
creating the FIR dialect of MLIR.

`Afforestation` (a class in the original FIR code)
of the FIR dialect tree structure has to be rewritten
as the original framework is replaced by that of
MLIR. Conceptually, the process and objective remains the same.

### FIR Dialect Details

The FIR dialect is a well-defined set of operations, types, etc. that
captures the executable semantics and state of a correctly specified
Fortran program. In Fortran, action statements [Fortran 2018 R515] and
certain constructs specify the behavior of the program. Among these,
Fortran expressions [Fortran 2018 Clause 10.1] are intrinsic to the
computation of new values.

#### FIR Operations

Abstract expression operations are higher-level operations that are
opaque computations in FIR. FIR does not know the exact computations
involved. However, the framework requires explicit representation of how
each operation interacts with others in terms of control flow,
data-flow, and the types of its operands and results. These operations
must then be lowered to sequences of operations as required by the
standard MLIR dialect, the LLVM IR dialect, etc.

##### Expression ops

The following lists the FIR abstract expression operations:

+    _Apply_Expr_

     This operation computes a (set of) value(s) by applying an abstract
     expression to a set of SSA input values.

     As well as its input values and type, an Apply_Expr takes two
     attributes that serve to bind the exact opaque expression from the
     front-end. The first attribute is the expression as recovered from
     the parse tree. The second attribute is a dictionary that maps the
     incoming values to positions in the expression representation,
     allowing values to bind to nodes in the expression.

+    _Locate_Expr_

     This operation computes a (set of) memory reference(s) by applying
     an abstract expression to a set of SSA input values.

     Exactly analogous to Apply_Expr, this operation also takes two
     attributes to capture the expression from the front-end and to bind
     arguments to nodes in the expression tree.

+    _Alloca_Expr_

     This operation allocates a temporary object of some specified
     type. The resulting object is undefined. It must be explicitly
     initialized with subsequent operations.

+    _Undefined_

     This operation yields the canonical undefined value of some
     type. This operation lowers to the undef instruction in LLVM IR. It
     is required for construction of register SSA form when load
     operations load uninitialized values.

+    _Load_Expr_

     This operation promotes a reference to a Fortran object (for
     example, the result of a Locate_Expr operation) to an object value
     irrespective of type. It takes one argument, a reference to an
     abstract storage location.

     Recall that the abstract expression operations listed here operate
     on and produce SSA values. (Specifically, they are abstract
     operations with precise control- and data-flow constraints.)

+    _Store_Expr_

     This operation demotes a value to a reference to an object. It
     takes two arguments: both a value and a reference to an abstract
     storage location (for example, the result of a Global_Expr
     operation) of the same type.

##### Control flow ops

Fortran has a number of mechanisms for specifying control flow, both
structured (DO ... END DO) and unstructured (GOTO). Many of these can be
directly lowered to the standard dialect's branch and conditional branch
operations.

There are a handful of multiway branch constructs to consider and these
will be modeled as FIR (terminator) operations. The framework supports a
generic terminator pattern operation. Specifically, a terminator is just
an operation but it is augmented with successors (references to basic
blocks) and successor arguments (for correct SSA form).

+    _Select_

     Terminator operation for switching based on the return value of,
     for example, an I/O action.

+    _Select_Case_

     Terminator operation for switching on the value of an expression.

+    _Select_Rank_

     Terminator operation for switching on the rank attribute of an
     object. Must be lowered to the requisite operations on the object's
     descriptor (which shall assumably contain the rank, dimension,
     type, etc. of the Fortran object).

+    _Select_Type_

     Terminator operation for switching on the type of an object. Must
     be lowered to the requisite operations on the object's type
     descriptor (which shall contain the encoded type of the Fortran
     object).

+    _Unreachable_

     This operation is a terminator on a Block and indicates that
     control flow cannot reach this point. This happens when lowering
     Fortran's [ERROR] STOP statement into a runtime call. It is lowered
     into the LLVM IR as an unreachable instruction.

For now, indirect branches (such as computed GOTO statements), will be
lowered by mapping target blocks into an indirect index value used in a
small chain of conditional branches. This could be changed to use the
standard dialect indirect branch op, however.

The standard dialect of MLIR supports calling procedures in full
generality -- that is, both function calls in expressions and CALL
statements to subroutines. Both cases will be lowered explicitly into
FIR using the standard dialect CallOp operation. The call operation is
an abstract application of a (presumably) opaque set of computations on
the SSA input values that produces a (set of) SSA result
value(s). (Semantically, a CallOp is a named morphism like the anonymous
ApplyExpr or LocateExpr.)

##### Miscellaneous ops

The presence of certain attributes on specific objects allow for dynamic
allocation and deallocation of those objects. These allocations and
deallocations can be explicit through the ALLOCATE and DEALLOCATE
statements or can be implied via side-effect. Dynamic allocation and
deallocation are modeled with FIR operations. It should be pointed out
that MLIR does not, at present, have a standard way of expressing an
object that has process lifetime (that is, "global" data like COMMON
blocks and MODULE variables) that is not a function. This is implemented
with the Global_Expr operation below.

+    _Allocmem_

     This operation allocates an object of a specified type and returns
     a reference to it. The object's lifetime is dynamic/indefinite and
     limited to a matching FreememOp operation that deallocates it. No
     side-effect behaviors are implied. Initialization of the object
     must be done explicitly in subsequent FIR operations.

+    _Freemem_

     This operation deallocates an object via a Fortran reference. Any
     use of the reference in subsequent code is undefined
     behavior. There are no implicit behaviors, so finalizers must be
     lowered explicitly into FIR.

+    _Global_Expr_

     This operation is a placeholder for a reference to an object in a
     storage location that has process lifetime (a global variable). It
     must have a type and a symbol name for binding at link-time.

+    _Extract_Value_

     This operation is similar to LLVM's `extractvalue` instruction.
     It allows the
     extraction of a value from a composite structure, such as a
     standard tuple.

+    _Insert_Value_

     The operation allows the insertion of a value into a composite
     structure, such as a standard tuple.

+    _Field_Value_

     This operation computes the offset of a component of a derived type
     for use in ExtractValue or InsertValue operations.

A number of Fortran action statements/constructs are related to
synchronization/threading. (e.g., LOCK, UNLOCK, EVENT POST, DO
CONCURRENT, co-arrays, etc.). The current plan is not to model these
parallel execution semantics directly in FIR, but to lower these
synchronization and threading statements to Fortran runtime calls. The
implicit message passing semantics of co-arrays can be lowered to
explicit calls as well, though the exact API is TBD.

#### FIR Types

Some Fortran intrinsic types are familiar and map well to MLIR standard
types. (e.g., `INTEGER*k`, `REAL*k`, and `COMPLEX*k`.)
However, the intrinsic
type `CHARACTER*k(LEN=n)` has no analog. Finally, the intrinsic type
`LOGICAL*k` and derived (user-defined) types should not be prematurely
lowered to standard MLIR types because that may inhibit optimization and
add complexity. (e.g., one could lower a `LOGICAL*`1 type to the standard
`i8` type, but then it would have the same type as `INTEGER*1` and,
depending on its usage, may have better been lowered to `i1`.)

In addition to types from the surface syntax of Fortran, it is
beneficial to introduce metatypes to FIR to capture Fortran attribute
properties that alter the underlying object in an operational
sense. Specifically, attributes such as `DIMENSION`, `CODIMENSION`, and
`POINTER`, alter the size, behavior, and accepted use of a variable but
not its type (in the Fortran sense).

The additional FIR types are as follows.

+    __FIRCharacterType__

     The Fortran intrinsic type CHARACTER with a kind value. This is
     meant to represent the constant-sized memory reference and is
     intentionally distinct from, for instance, an array of byte-sized
     integers. The LEN parameter of a CHARACTER should be represented as
     a second integer member in a FIR tuple type. Concretely, a Fortran
     CHARACTER type is lowered into a pair:

     `(FIRReferenceType<FIRCharacterType<K>>, Integer<K'>)`

+    __FIRLogicalType__

     The Fortran intrinsic type LOGICAL with a kind value.

+    __FIRRealType__

     The Fortran intrinsic type REAL with kind values (e.g., KIND=16)
     that do not map to standard MLIR.

+    __FIRReferenceType__

     The Fortran concept of "reference". Actual arguments are typically
     passed as references to objects of some type, for example. All
     objects that reside in memory are accessible via reference types.

+    __FIRSequenceType__

     The Fortran concept of an object with rank > 0. Fortran does not
     have an array type, but FIR characterizes objects with rank as
     sequences of their base type.

     In lowering a Fortran array object, the dimensions and extents of
     the array may not be known at compile time, and therefore may need
     to be lowered to a tuple type that describes the array's structure
     (rank, type, dimension information, other attributes).

+    __FIRTupleType__

     Fortran derived types naturally map to tuples. Can be used to build
     other type packages as well, such as Fortran's CHARACTER type with
     its LEN parameter, array object structure descriptors, etc. Each
     distinct tuple type has a unique name and a run-time encoding, the
     type descriptor. (Note: any subtyping relationships between derived
     types must be established by and lowered from the front-end.)

+    __FIRTypeDesc__

     The meta-type of all type descriptors. An instance of a type
     descriptor is a constant object that encodes a Fortran (intrinsic,
     derived) type for use by the runtime, etc. This type is
     speculative, as it may be (more) satisfactory to encode a type
     descriptor as a simple dope vector sequence.

### Changes from Original Document

Procedure calls will be unwrapped from Fortran expressions and lowered
into FIR dialect calls to expose control flow.

These computations will be presented in a memory-based SSA format, where
memory objects will be referenced via special operation forms.

There will be a pass to lower
the memory-based SSA form to a
register-based (proper) SSA form. There will be no
&Phi; nodes.

There will be no scope enter, scope exit pairs.

There will be a pass to lower the FIR dialect to the MLIR standard
dialect and/or LLVM IR dialect.
